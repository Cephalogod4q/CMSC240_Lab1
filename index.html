        <h3>Ishtar 2.0</h3>
        <p>For the past few decades I have been fascinated with nonsense speech. It probably started
          when I first read 
          <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Wonderland-Looking-Glass-complete-illustrations-ebook/dp/B010WCDO9E/">
            Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.</a> I have forgotten when I first encountered Lorem Ipsum, but it got
          me to think about how to have nonsense text based on something other than degenerate Latin. So I wrote the
          original version of Ishtar in C++. The source code has been lost. 
        <p>Along came Python, and I needed to learn a lot about it in a hurry. So I did what all
            experienced programmers do: I rewrote a program whose design was already well known to me,
            and Ishtar 2.0 is the result.
        <p>At times, the output of Ishtar 2.0 seems rather insightful, and Donald Trump continues to provide 
          source material. His fascinatingly small vocabulary intrigues me, and Ishtar's algorithm is ideally 
          suited to drive his teleprompter. For example one of those is Ishtar's regurgitation and one is 
          Don's original. 
        <ol>
        <li> Well — well, I don't like it, and maybe it will take longer than Dwight D. Eisenhower, who 
          helped win World War II. And we spent probably, if you add it up now, $4 trillion, maybe more 
          than just — in my opinion is that they wanted to do, but for traveling and for other things, 
          you know, I felt, again, knowing the people said, 'pay.'

        <li> Well — well, I don't know, first call or second call, they will be a very powerful call, that's 
          going to be a great relationship. They'll be great allies, they always have been. And I think zero 
          will change on that score. There has never been a better ally, and I think nothing will change on 
          that score.
        </ol>
        <p>Not bad, eh? I have forgotten which was the original, and they are so similar that it probably
        makes no difference.
        <p>Development at this time is going toward understanding sentence patterns so that the generated
          text resembles the original as much as possible. Ishtar currently understands parts of speech,
          vocabulary, stems, and function v. content words. Once it can speak extemporaneously in complete
          sentences, it will be time to take a rest and try something else.
